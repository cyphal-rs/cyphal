# Introduction

Cyphal is an open technology for real-time intravehicular distributed computing and communication based
on modern networking standards (Ethernet, CAN FD, etc.). It was created to address the challenge of
on-board deterministic computing and data distribution in next-generation intelligent vehicles: manned and
unmanned aircraft, spacecraft, robots, and cars.
