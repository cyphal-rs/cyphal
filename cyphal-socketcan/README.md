# Cyphal/CAN Socketcan

Open Cyphal SocketCAN Rust Implementation

ðŸš§ ***Work in progress*** ðŸš§

## Environment

To run the tests, two virtual CAN interfaces must be setup.  In both cases, the vcan kernel module needs to be loaded:

```bash
modprobe vcan
```

### CAN 2.0 vcan0 interface

```bash
ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
ip link set vcan0 mtu 16
ip link set up vcan0
```

### CAN FD vcan1 interface

```bash
ip link add dev vcan1 type vcan
ip link set vcan1 mtu 72
ip link set up vcan1
```

### Extra Tools

It can also be quite usefull for testing ad debugging to install can utilities:

```bash
apt-get install can-tools
```
